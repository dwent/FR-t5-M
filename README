Installation: 

(0) Before installation, please make sure the following
    softwares or databases are installed properly.
	1. Modeller;
	2. NR Database (or) u90 Database;
	3. FR-t5_data;
	4. MEFTop_Model and Fea37_parameter;
	5. NNCon

    Modeller could be download from the website:
	http://salilab.org/modeller/download_installation.html

    U90 Database, which is designed by our laboratory, can
    be downloaded at:
	http://jianglab.ibp.ac.cn/lims/FRt5M/FRt5M.html
	
	FR-t5_data is the structure library for FR-t5 and can be download at:
	https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn10155874
	
	MEFTop_Model and Fea37_parameter are parameter libraries for MEFTop and can be download at:
	https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn10155869
	https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn10155872
	
	NNCon is the contact map predictor and can be download at:

(1) Uncompress the tar.gz file
	tar -zvxf FR-t5-M.tar.gz

(2) Change work path to the package, and open configure.sh
	cd FR-t5-M/
	cp FR-t5_data/data/* FR-t5-M/FR-t5/data/*
	cp MEFTop_Model/Model/* FR-t5-M/MEFTop/Model/*
	cp Fea37_parameter/parameter/* FR-t5-M/MEFTop/parameter/*

(3) Set $Modeller_Path to the directory of Modeller;
    Set $NR_Database or $U90_Database or both of them;

(4) Save the file. 

(5) Run configure.sh to configure it. After that, this 
    package can be moved to anywhere.
	./configure.sh
    

(6) run assembly.sh to start work, or use the jar file:
	java -jar FR-t5-M.jar

How to use:

(1) Run the jar file.

    When running the java program, you could submit as much as 
    5 sequences at a time, which can be loaded from your local 
    disk or pasted from the clipboard. It's OK to edit the 
    textbox directly.
 
    To predict protein structures, three directories will be 
    established in the output path:
	1. Input/	Your could find you sequences there.
	2. Work/	Main works are done in this directory.
	3. Output/	It's the place to store the selected 
                        protein structures.

    The standard output and standard error message are redirected
    to $ID.stdout and $ID.stderr file, respectively ($ID is your
    work ID).

(2) Run the shell script 'assembly.sh'.

    For example, if you want to predict the structure of "T0684.fasta",
    and it's in "~/Sequence/", you may type the command like that:

	./assembly.sh -f ~/Sequence/T0684.fasta -o ~/Result

    In this command, "~/Result" is the place for output. If 
    "-f" option changed to "-d", the scipt will find all the 
    fasta files in the path specified by the argument after 
    "-d", and predict their structures:

	./assembly.sh -d ~/Sequence/ -o ~/Result

    More options can be found if "./assembly.sh" is typed.
    
(3) UpdateLib.tar.gz could be used to update the library folder FR-t5/data
